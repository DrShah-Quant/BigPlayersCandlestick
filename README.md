 <h1>PeriodBigPlayersCandlesticks</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This Python program analyzes volume and transaction patterns alongside Japanese candlestick price action for a specific stock, using historical tick data.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Libraries Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b> 
- <b>Matplotlib</b>
- <b>NumPy</b>
- <b>CSV</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10 Pro</b>
- <b>Jupyter Notebook</b>

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<p align="justify"> The Program walk-through is similar to <a href="https://github.com/DrShah-Quant/PeriodBigPlayers"> PeriodBigPlayers </a> except this version augments Japanese Candlesick for a different analysis dimension. Therefore, the documentation remains the same with some additional details added.</p>

<p align="justify"> The example run presented here is from a Jupyter Notebook environment. You can run the file using Ctrl+Enter key presses. Alternatively you can run the python script <i>PeriodBigPlayersCandlesticks.py</i> using command <i>python PeriodBigPlayersCandlesticks.py</i> in a command line if you have python installed properly. The program is depended on a CSV file containing stock transactions raw data. In the example presented below, I have used raw data provided by M+ Securities, a Malaysian stock broker. The raw data contains comma separated values organized into the following colums: "Time","Type","Price","Chg","Vol","Value". "Time" is the time when the transaction occured. "Type" refers to the type of transaction such as buy, close, and open. "Price" refers to the price the share was transacted. "Chg" refers to the difference from the previous price. "Vol" refers to the transaction volume measured in lot sizes (1 lot = 100 shares). And finally "Value" refers to the value of the trasaction (i.e. no of shares x share price). </p>

<br />
 <p align="justify">The legend lists the percentile rank achieved by buy and sell transactions at the 80th percentile for the whole of the period in consideration (i.e. the CVS dataset date range). In the example, top 20% (i.e. above percentile 80) buy volumes are all over 200 lots (percentile rank = 200) and top 20% sell volumes are all over 100 lots. </p>

Above 80 percentile buy/sell volume transactions along with Japanese Candlestics: <br/>

<br />
 <p align="justify"> The figure above shows periodic time series illustrating the top 20% volume transactions along with Japanese Candlestics. Assuming big players (e.g. fund managers, high net worth individuals, etc) transact in large quantities, from this figure we can know at what price and when the transactions occur. The percentile rank (as found in the legend) indicates us on the reliability of our assumption -- it is more reliable if the percentile rank is above the average of a longer period. The augmented Japanese Candlesticks adds more insights (e.g. big players transactions at open and close, also along the body and tails).  </p>

Number of buy and sell transactions with volume per buy (or sell) transaction along with Japanese Candlestics:  <br/>

<br />
 <p align="justify"> The figure above is a time series depicting the volume of buy (or sell) transactions at each price level across the time domain. The visualization highlights the price level that attracts the most buying or selling activity. Corresponding to this information, we are also presented with volume per buy(or sell) transaction at each price level to enable us analyse the magnitude of interest at each price level. The augmented Japanese Candlesticks adds more insights (e.g. overall transactions at open and close, also along the body and tails).    </p>
